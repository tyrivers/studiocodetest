# studiocodetest
Code Test repository for Studio application by Tyler Rivers

<strong>Motivation</strong><br />
I built this applet because I would like to join the team at Studio by Engrain! It is at their direction and discretion.

<strong>Code Style Standard</strong>

<strong>Tech/framework used</strong><br />
PHP7.2, HTML5, cURL, CSS3

<strong>Features</strong><br />
This project collects data from the endpoint API Studio provided, sorting the resulting data into two lists. One list displays entries from the API without a valid area in square feet, the other displays correctly updated entries. Both are displayed in a clear visual manner for the end user.

<strong>Installation</strong><br />
Upload the included files to your desired host and load the codetest_output.php file at its local address. Or, visit tylerrivers.com/codetest/codetest_output.php

<strong>How to use?</strong><br />
Simply load the page and view the output data.

<strong>Contribute</strong><br />
You could hire me to work at Studio, if you're reading this. Then we could work on it together!

<strong>Credits</strong><br />
Thanks Brittany, Marta & Jason for your time and energy so far.
