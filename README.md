# studiocodetest
Code Test repository for Studio application by Tyler Rivers

Motivation
I built this applet because I would like to join the team at Studio by Engrain! It is at their direction and discretion.

Code Style Standard

Tech/framework used
PHP7.2, HTML5, cURL, CSS3

Features
This project collects data from the endpoint API Studio provided, sorting the resulting data into two lists. One list displays entries from the API without a valid area in square feet, the other displays correctly updated entries. Both are displayed in a clear visual manner for the end user.

Installation
Upload the included files to your desired host and load the codetest_output.php file at its local address. Or, visit tylerrivers.com/codetest/codetest_output.php

How to use?
Simply load the page and view the output data.

Contribute
You could hire me to work at Studio, if you're reading this. Then we could work on it together!

Credits
Thanks Brittany, Marta & Jason for your time and energy so far.
